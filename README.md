# Rocky Mountain Fluid Mechanics Research Symposium Repository

This is the official Github page for the Rocky Mountain Fluid Mechanics (RMFM) Research Symposium held annually at the University of Colorado Boulder.

## Basic Formatting Details

The website is rather simple and should be trivial to update each year. Some basic guidelines are included below in order to ensure consistency year-to-year.

#### Attachments

Within the `attachments` directory, you will see the previous years' schedules, call for abstracts, and technical programs. Each follows the general naming convention of:

`RMFM####_FileName.pdf`

where `####` represents the current year. Please take care to maintain this formatting for organization and archival purposes.

#### Logo

The annual logo resides in the `images` directory, following the naming convention

`logo####.png`

where `####` again represents the year.

## Updating the Website

The website is lightweight and thus you should be able to view changes in any standard web browser on your machine. The entire site resides within `index.html` and should be straightforward to edit. There is no CSS or any other complicating features to account for - simply edit the information and links to reflect the current year's information.
