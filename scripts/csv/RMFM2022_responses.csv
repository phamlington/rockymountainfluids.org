The interplay between the magnetic fields and the fluid motion gives rise to complex flow physics, which depends on the electrical conductivity of the bounding walls. An effective approach to represent the latter is via the Shercliff boundary condition for thin conducting walls relating the induced magnetic field and its wall-normal gradient at the boundary via a parameter referred to as the wall conductance ratio. Here, we present two new boundary schemes that enforce the Shercliff boundary condition in the LB schemes for MHD bounded by conducting walls. One approach is constructed using a link-based formulation involving a weighted combination of the bounce back and anti-bounce back of the distribution function for the magnetic field and the other approach involves an on-node moment-based implementation.

The presence of surfactants in these flows can significantly alter the interfacial dynamics and are often exploited to enhance wetting and de-wetting processes by either supporting or suppressing coalescence of bubbles and drops in the dispersed phase. On the other hand, self-re-wetting fluids exhibit nonlinear dependence of surface tension on temperature that cause fluid motions towards hotter regions, which has been exploited in thermal management applications. The common feature in these flows is a locally varying surface tension resulting in complex Marangoni convection. In this study we present a variety of these flows and discuss the effects of variable surface tension. Specifically, we show how surfactants effect the dynamics of bubbles as well as how self-rewetting fluids behave in a microchannel with sinusoidal heating profile. To simulate these flows, we use  robust central moment lattice Boltzmann schemes involving three distribution functions to solve the fluid motion and the energy transport, and track interfaces via a phase-field model. Furthermore, we utilize high performance computing with the MPI library for parallel simulations on the new Alderaan cluster at CU Denver.","Multiphase flows, surfactants, self-rewetting fluids, variable surface tension",Yes,bashir.elbousefi@ucdenver.edu,Bashir,Elbousefi,Graduate,University of Colorado Denver,Mechanical Engineering,Yes,kannan.premnath@ucdenver.edu,Kannan,Premnath,Associate Professor,University of Colorado Denver,Mechanical Engineering,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These devices are often fueled with fossil fuels and emit large quantities of GHG, and NOx. To meet environmental regulations, Colorado State is assisting Solar Turbines to create a low-emission industrial gas turbine system capable of operating high levels of hydrogen in Natural Gas mixtures. Hydrogen is an efficient source of thermochemical energy and can be produced through electrolysis systems powered by excess renewable electricity. When combusted, hydrogen produces H2O in place of CO2, making it a more favorable approach to limiting GHG. Concerns with this alternative fuel lie in hydrogens' high flame speed and temperature, which increases the risk of flashback and NOx production. To address this, a high fidelity and tractable chemical mechanism is needed to correctly model flame behavior, NOx emissions, autoignition, and extinction accurately. This will support the computational-aided design of next-generation combustion systems. This project will evaluate previously developed mechanisms on their accuracy in computing experimental flame speeds and ignition delay, as well as produce a reduced mechanism for use in advanced CFD simulations.

While a significant amount of research has gone into understanding aerosol sampling efficiency for aircraft inlets, a similar research investment has not been made for gas sampling.   Here, we analyze the performance of a laminar gas inlet to establish its performance as a function of operating conditions, including ambient pressure, freestream velocities, and sampling conditions.  Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling we simulate flow inside and outside the inlet to determine the extent of freestream turbulent interaction with the sample flow and its implication for gas sample transport.

Over the last two decades, theoretical studies have focused mostly on understanding aspects of self-diffusiophoretic motion for spheroidal and cylindrical geometries.

In recent years, experiments have demonstrated rich particle-fluid dynamics when geometric asymmetry is introduced in diffusiophoretic systems. The standard boundary element method can describe the hydrodynamics for arbitrarily shaped particles but becomes computationally expensive for particles with a high aspect ratio. Current asymptotic theories for such slender geometries in phoretic flows are inadequate in understanding the motion of bent rods with no axial symmetry.

In our proposed framework, using boundary layer theory we explain the diffusiophoretic interactions at a continuum scale and then rely on reciprocal relations to obtain particle velocity. We see that the particles would turn continuously or translate with a stable orientation depending on the interplay of phoretic and hydrodynamic interactions. Our framework can predict a priori particle trajectories by understanding these interactions.","Slender-body theory, diffusiophoresis, self-propulsion",Yes,ankur.gupta@colorado.edu,Ankur,Gupta,Assistant Professor,University of Colorado Boulder,Chemical and Biological Engineering,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of these devices use both reduction/oxidation reactions and electrical double layers. However, models which account for both effects often assume that the double layers and reactions are independent. As such, the balance of transport processes which governs the dynamics of coupled double layers and reactions remains unclear. 

In this talk, we present a physics-based theoretical framework to capture the dynamics of a model cell that couples the effects of double layers and electrochemical reactions. We use a perturbation analysis to solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations, which enables us to predict spatial variations in ion concentration and potential at two distinct timescales: double layer charging and bulk diffusion. Our framework allows for any number of reactions and ions in the thin double layer limit. From our analysis, we discover that reaction rate directly affects double layer formation and the two processes cannot be treated independently. Furthermore, our model reveals that the thickness of electrical double layers is dependent on reaction rate, which implies that reactions can be used to control the capacitance of the overall system.

In these geometries, electric double layers form close to the boundaries and screen the electric field, influencing transport. Therein, the characteristic pore thickness is typically comparable to the double-layer thickness. Notwithstanding, the literature focuses on the cases of flat-plate electrodes and valence- and diffusivity-symmetric electrolytes. Accounting for arbitrary double-layer thickness and electrolyte asymmetry is important to optimizing electrochemical energy storage devices.

We proposed a novel model for ion transport in a pore for a binary electrolyte with arbitrary double-layer thickness, ionic valences, and ionic diffusivities, based on a linearization of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations. We show that diffusivity asymmetry drives nontrivial salt dynamics coupled to the charge dynamics even at low potentials, with potential applications to capacitive deionization. We quantify the control of valences and diffusivities over the two timescales governing the charging dynamics of asymmetric electrolytes at a constant capacitance, an absent feature in widely used transmission line representations.","Electric double layers, valences, diffusivities, porous networks",Yes,ankur.gupta@colorado.edu,Ankur,Gupta,Assistant Professor,University of Colorado Boulder,Chemical and Biological Engineering,Yes,pzuk@princeton.edu,Pawel,Zuk,Assistant Professor,"Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, PL",Physical Chemistry,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyze output from four simulations of the surface ocean boundary layer with varying intensities of Langmuir turbulence.  We find that Langmuir turbulence decreases the spatial variability of surface ocean acidity indicators pH and .  When no turbulence is present, pH and  have high spatial variability and elevated mean values.  As turbulence is intensified, the mean values for both variables decrease and variance decreases.  Increased Langmuir turbulence generates deeper mixing and a deepening of the carbocline (the depth of the maximum vertical carbon gradient).  Our results suggest that calcium carbonate-shelled organisms experience high variability in ocean acidity indicators pH and , which could affect both their shell-building (pH) and shell maintenance ().  As ocean acidification continues to plague marine organisms, these findings can help shape our understanding of organisms’ exposure to acidification variability during their life history.

In this work, we present on how a two-dimensional solute concentration field, generated by sources and sinks, can program the distribution of diffusiophoretic particles. First, we investigate how changing the dipolar separation distance between a source and sink can locally enrich or deplete particles. An interplay between characteristic flux decay and diffusion timescales controls enrichment in dipole systems and leads to a separation distance with maximal particle enrichment. We then study how geometric asymmetry in systems with four sources and four sinks can be used to systematically control particle banding structure and optimize particle enrichment. Overall, our findings show how the geometric arrangement of sources and sinks, as well as the diffusion and flux decay timescales, can be utilized to engineer systems with controlled particle banding structures.","Diffusiophoresis, Particles, Optimization",Yes,Charles.Shields@colorado.edu,C.

To this end, 3-dimensional energy-containing turbulent structures were captured and reconstructed within the surface layer of a turbulent boundary layer and track their local evolution. Cross-tunnel planes of time-resolved stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements were collected in a turbulent boundary layer with a thickness δ=28 cm and Re_θ=7680 in the LMFL wind tunnel. The resulting flow field was transformed into a quasi-3D spatial domain through locally applying Taylor’s frozen flow hypothesis to the time-resolved data. The error and practical limitations of this temporal to spatial transformation are assessed for this region of the flow utilizing a corresponding time-resolved streamwise plane. From this plane the error between the transformed streamwise dimension and the actual streamwise dimension is quantified.

Thus, it is important to investigate how physical and geometrical parameters such as the capillary number Ca, viscosity ratio λ, and drop size affect the motion of a droplet in straight, rectangular microfluidic channels. In this work, we study the motion of such droplets through numerical simulations and experiments. To this end, we use a boundary-integral algorithm to simulate a droplet moving through an infinitely-long, straight, rectangular channel analyzing how physical parameters affected drop velocity. Increasing the Ca results in a faster and more deformable droplet, whereas an increase in λ results in a slower droplet.

In this study, surface pressure and particle image velocimetry measurements are used to analyze the unsteady flow physics of a separated NACA 0015 wing in global streamwise gusts, which impose a time-varying velocity on the wing. Unsteadiness exhibited in the wing’s aerodynamic response to velocity acceleration and deceleration can be attributed to the dynamics of developing vortical structures on the suction side. Whether the flow is accelerating or decelerating determines the temporal and spatial scales of the vortical structures, including the convective time, size, and location from which vortical structures develop and shed. These scales determine the degree to which vortical structures interact with each other and with the wing surface, thereby also influencing the unsteady loading on the wing.

In this framework, the geometry of the flow domain, defined by level-set functions, is immersed into a structured tensor-product background mesh. The FE approximation is enriched to consistently interpolate the flow variables and to avoid spurious coupling of geometrically separate flow regions. B-spline basis functions are employed for improved continuity of the solution, and to enable local hierarchical refinement. Essential boundary conditions are imposed weakly via Nitsche’s method. The immersed method is stabilized using Ghost stabilization. The flow problems are stabilized using the SUPG and PSPG methods.

Our meshing algorithm allows for simulation of complex channel geometries, including the main ones that are used in microfluidic devices. The presence of the front and back panels produces extra tail formations. The infinite-depth limit is analyzed by comparing the results to the ones obtained by infinite-depth simulations.

Early results suggest that PCD is indeed a very efficient solver, in particular in two dimensions, as long as the Reynold's number remains small. Next we will try to reorder our degrees of freedom such that we can use GMRES with ILU for our linear solve.

This leads to precipitation of solutes.

Surprisingly, no prior work considers that temperature and concentration polarization increase the feed density near the membrane. We show that with gravity properly oriented, this can trigger a buoyancy-driven instability in which plumes of cool, solute-rich, feed sink away from the membrane.

In this paper, we show that training autoencoders with additional physics-informed regularizations, e.g., incompressibility and preservation of enstrophy, improves a baseline model without such regularizations in three ways: i) upon inspection of the trained compression filters of the neural network, we identify changes in the convolutions due to the inclusion of the physics-informed terms ii) the compressions prove to be more physics-conforming to homogeneous isotropic turbulences of different Reynolds numbers given that these adhere to both the divergence free condition and preservation of enstrophy without trading off reconstruction quality, and iii) as a performance byproduct, training shows to converge 4 times faster than the baseline model.","Incompressible flows, high performance computing, compression ratio",Yes,ahmed.zamzam@nrel.gov,Ahmed,Zamzam,National Lab Researcher,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,,Yes,andrew.glaws@nrel.gov,Andrew,Glaws,National Lab Researcher,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,,Yes,ryan.king@nrel.gov,Ryan,King,National Lab Researcher,National Renewable Energy Laboratory,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the potential for PID suction to distort filaments and to modify sensed time records remains unclear. We used computational fluid dynamics to model a common PID to quantify and parameterize suction distortion by considering how sensed time records compare to those registered by an ideal probe. Models cover a range of realistic plumes, and we show that PID can significantly modify the peak concentration and pulse shape of sensed records. We quantified distortion variations in three nondimensional parameters describing PID geometry and sampling conditions: relative suction rate, relative filament size, and ambient flow Reynolds number. We used analytical models, dimensional analysis, and scaling arguments to interpret results and discuss when distortion is likely and what drives it. We built dimensionless distortion prediction regressions, and our results enable PID users to estimate distortion levels and to employ mitigation strategies through suction velocity tuning. These findings can inform distortion-mitigating design principles and best sampling practices for other suction-based passive scalar sensing schemes.","passive scalar distortion, suction flow, photoionization detectors",Yes,crimaldi@colorado.edu,John,Crimaldi,Professor,University of Colorado Boulder,CEAE,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study analyzes the response of wind turbines to canonical inflows with a spatial or temporal oscillation in inflow velocity field. Individual blade sections are demonstrated to experience highly unsteady angle of attack variations from spatial waveforms in the inflow, potentially leading to undesired load effects. Temporally varying inflow fluctuations produce integrated loads that are nearly an order of magnitude higher than the response to spatial oscillations. Further investigation of the load response to canonical temporal or spatial oscillations can facilitate more resilient turbine design by reducing the number of critical simulation cases and helping wind turbine designers identify flows of interest.

In our previous work, direct numerical simulations of three-dimensional axisymmetric helium plume were conducted to understand the effect of the inlet-based Reynolds (Re) and Richardson (Ri) numbers on the flowfield. From these simulations, some fundamental questions still remain unanswered with respect to the laminar unsteady plumes in the limit of large Re, including: (i) do all laminar plumes transition to turbulence in the near-field, (ii) is the Strouhal number scaling most applicable at large Re, and (iii) do pressure effects on the downstream transport of fluid become negligible at large Re?

Thrust generation using electromagnetic body forces is advantageous to conventional chemical fuel-based propulsion systems because they are not limited to the stagnation pressures necessary for combustion. Thus, hypersonic propulsion is possible for high Mach number flight at high altitudes. Indeed, one-dimensional theoretical analyses of magnetohydrodynamic acceleration predict that the electromagnetic fields must be carefully designed for efficient acceleration at high Mach numbers. Both one- and three-dimensional simulations of preliminary plasma fueled engine geometries show that the electromagnetic fields must be tailored such that the Lorentz force overcomes the pressure gradient formed by Joule heating.

Researchers use UAS technology for various projects including wind turbine studies. UAS are ideal to study turbine wakes created around wind farms and can help improve the understanding of inter-turbine interactions. Another exciting potential application of UAS technology relates to studying shear induced turbulence in the upper oceans. Wind is one of the main forcing terms for ocean mixing and observation through UAS measurement is an important part of validating and informing ocean numerical models.    

Using UAS to measure wind can be achieved by several methods. One tool commonly used is the multi hole probe (MHP). These probes rely on differential pressure measurements as well as inertial measurements and GPS data to compute wind vectors. External sensors like MHPs can become occluded by water when it rains or be damaged during landings. An alternative could be an accelerometer matrix which would measure forces on a UAS airframe. Using thrust, orientation and heading information it is possible to determine wind components.

SDF represents the distance of any point within the domain from its nearest boundary. Thus, collision is indicated when the distance value is less than the particle radius, and subsequently the contact event and resulting change in momentum is resolved. Our approach reduces the number of contact checks thereby reducing the complexity of the collision algorithm. We demonstrate two case-studies: (a) an idealized test verifying the effectiveness of our approach in terms of computational time, and (b) a real-world application for calculating particle trajectories in a flow field for patient-specific arterial geometries.

We numerically investigate and develop a pseudopotential lattice Boltzmann model (LB) with multiple relaxation times (MRT) combined with the energy equation to simulate thermal multiphase flows with phase change (e.g., nucleate boiling). The use of the pseudopotential LB model is an attractive approach to studying heat transfer phenomena for two phase flows due to its simplicity. Thermodynamic consistency is realized by forcing mechanical equilibrium to agree with the Maxwell construction. The energy equation is solved using regular second-order finite differences. This thesis proposal introduces a new formulation of the force term in a multiple relaxation time (MRT)-lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for the axisymmetric class. The proposed model is based on a simpler and more stable orthogonal moment basis, while the use of MRT introduces additional flexibility, and the model maintains the stream-collide procedure. The pseudopotential LB model is numerically validated via the simulations of static drop, as well as with the simulation of the Stephan problem for 1-D phase change and metastable boiling state.
